## Overview

Iron Vest is a customizable linear release vesting product powered by Ferrum Network's [Linear Release Engine](https://app.gitbook.com/o/4kmBmwCSGs18VyCPwcJE/s/9kF2UEQC3ocvK4ZPbN6k/). Iron Vest empowers project owners with the tools to protect the community's holdings by mitigating dump days through linear release vesting.&#x20;

Project owners can set up custom vesting pools with or without a cliff (lock) period. The linear release engine makes tokens claimable for end users every second after the cliff (lock) period is over. Project owners even have the option to implement a linear release for the cliff (lock) period tokens to further mitigate dump days from a large chunk of cliff (lock) period tokens.
